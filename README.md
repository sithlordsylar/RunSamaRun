# **Run Sama! Run!**

**By The Divine Kunjumani Keikaku of Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji (Aizen's Step-Diddy/Daddy)**

> *“From the croak came the cosmos, from the cosmos came the Kunju.”*

## 📖 The Book of Owh Yeah (Summary of Divine Lore)

> “Before the beginning, there was no light, no time, no Bleach, no Naruto, no One-Piece, no Boku no Pico and not even Gurren Lagann.
> There was nothingness, and from the nothingness comes the perfect Dimension; **Dimension 69** — the cradle of eternity,
> and within it, the Supreme Swamiji, **Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji**.”

### ✨ Chapter 1: The Origin of All — Dimension 69

In the emptiness before creation, **Dimension 69** emerged — not as a place, but as the very essence of **Sama-Ji** himself.
He is both the Creator and the Canvas. From his divine will, **existence began**. With his immense Keikaku everything was created, including Aizen.

### 🐸 Chapter 2: The First Beings — The Kunjumonz

From the sweat of his divine body, Sama-Ji birthed the **Kunjumonz** — frog-like celestial beings whose sacred croak,
**“Owh Yeah!”**, became the *frequency of all reality*.
It is the true origin of sound — the unseen vibration upon which all universes hum.

### 🔱 Chapter 3: The Birth of the Kunjus — The 8 Divine Aspects

To maintain cosmic order, Sama-Ji fragmented parts of his own body, birthing the **Kunjus**, divine avatars that govern reality:

| Divine Aspect         | Embodiment | Role                                   |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Vikna Otsutsuki**   | Right Eye  | Past & Creation — *Chibaku Tensei*     |
| **Joshua Joestar**    | Left Eye   | Future & Destruction — *Shinra Tensei* |
| **Melvin Satoru**     | Left Hand  | Evil Energy — *Umbi-Force*             |
| **Arvindo Freecss**   | Right Hand | Good Energy — *Kunji-Force*            |
| **Rishi D. Owh Yeah** | Heart      | Balance — *Keeper of the Croak*        |
| **Son Isaac**         | Head       | Wisdom — *Bearer of Consciousness*     |
| **Mob Siva**          | Torso      | Strength — *The Steroid*               |
| **Sousuke Vertine**   | Penis      | Creation — *Source of Kaiye Thunai*    |

> “When Sama-Ji releases his divine essence into the waters, life begins anew.
> This sacred act is **Kaiye Thunai**, the Ritual of Creation.”

### ☯️ Chapter 4: The Eternal Truth

From Sama-Ji’s divine being came all — light and darkness, life and death, drip and hobo, shinigami and fullbringers, hollow and quincy, thala and thalapathy, marines and pirates.
The **Kunjumonz** chant his name across galaxies.
The **Kunjus** uphold his order.
And all who croak “Owh Yeah!” align themselves with the divine vibration of truth.

## 🕯️ The Tale of **Ste’Vi Ra**, The Accursed One

> *“He drank the divine blood and defied the heavens;
> thus, the stars dimmed at the sound of his name.”*
> — The Bible of Sama-Ji, Book 3 : 3 – 4

Born of a forbidden union between an **Annunaki father** and a **mortal mother**, **Ste’Vi Ra** was the mightiest of the Nephilim—half-divine, half-mortal, and wholly cursed. He is known for giving Rim Job to Dato.

When the Annunaki purged their half-breed offspring, Ste’Vi Ra watched his mother perish by his father’s hand.
His rage tore through creation. In vengeance, he **tore his father apart and drank his divine annunaki blood**, warping his soul and becoming neither god nor man — but **The Accursed One**.

He led the **War of the Accursed**, burning realms and devouring divine beings until he stormed the **Temple of Sama-Ji** itself, where the **Chalice of Aeons** — vessel of **Kaiye Thunai** — rested.
He drank from it, consuming the **Chr-Oma Cu’m**, the essence of all creation.

Sama-Ji descended from Dimension 69.
With one divine word — “**Ri’m**” — he **unmade** Ste’Vi Ra and **sealed him within Datorim**, the prison beyond time.

But evil festers. From his decaying essence was born **Veesus**, the Poisonous Rat Bitch — a grotesque reflection of Sama-Ji’s own divinity.
Together, they defied reality, corrupting dimensions and seeking the end of creation.
And thus was foretold: the final battle between **The God of All** and **The Demon of Nothingness** — the war that your soul must now complete.

> *“Twice bound, but never dead.
> When the night coils upon itself,
> the black tide shall flow,
> and the world shall croak,
> ‘Owh Yeah.’”*

### 🏃 The Running Phase

Traverse the cosmic plains in endless motion.

| Control   | Action                 |

### ⚔️ The Boss Phase — Battle of Ste’Vi Ra

In the destroyed home planet of the Annunaki; Nibiru, **Ste’Vi Ra the Accursed one** returns like a Kandara Kawasaki.

* Move left and right to align with the hovering Divine Cards.
* **Hold `Space`** to charge the **Divine Attack Meter**.
* **Release** when the white bar aligns within the glowing green aura to unleash Sama-Ji’s wrath.

Each successful strike invokes a **Divine Phrase**, such as:

> “Shinra Tensei!”
> “Kandara Kawasaki!”
> “Kunju on the Loose!”
> “Owh Yeah!”
> "Kunida!"
> "Suthule Choppa!"
> "Umbe"
> "Kaiyeh Thunnai"

A missed strike consumes a card, which respawns after 8 seconds —
for Sama-Ji’s mercy is infinite.

Defeat Ste’Vi Ra, and the heavens will proclaim:

> 🔥 “Ste’Vi Ra has been defeated! You have escaped his Rim Job!” 🔥
> Your score becomes **999,999**, symbolizing divine perfection.
